# Dealer DMS

A car dealership inventory management system: an authenticated admin
dashboard for managing inventory, and a public-facing website that
automatically publishes every vehicle marked **Available**. Hebrew
(RTL) throughout; code and comments in English.

One app, one deploy target. Supabase provides the database,
authentication, and image storage — there's no separate backend to
run or deploy.

## Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript, built with Vite
- React Router (v8 — the package is now just `react-router`, not
  `react-router-dom`)
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage) via `@supabase/supabase-js`
- TanStack Query for data fetching/caching
- Tailwind CSS v4
- React Hook Form + Zod for forms

## 1. Create your Supabase project

1. [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → New Project. Pick a name, a
   database password (save it), and a region close to your users.
2. Once it's ready, go to **SQL Editor**, paste the contents of
   `supabase/schema.sql`, and run it. This creates every table, the
   access-control rules, and the image storage bucket.
3. Same again with `supabase/seed.sql` — this loads demo inventory.
4. **Settings → API**: copy the **Project URL** and the **anon /
   public key** — you'll need both next.

## 2. Create your first login

Supabase Auth doesn't have public signup wired up here on purpose —
staff accounts are created by you, not by anyone who finds the login
page.

1. **Authentication → Users → Add user** in the Supabase dashboard.
   Set an email and password.
2. This automatically creates a matching row in `profiles` with the
   default role `editor` (see `schema.sql`'s trigger). To make this
   first account a super admin, go to **SQL Editor** and run:
   ```sql
   update public.profiles set role = 'super_admin' where email = 'you@example.com';
   ```
3. Repeat step 1 for any other staff accounts you want (`admin` or
   `editor` roles can be set the same way).

## 3. Run it locally

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in the two Supabase values from step 1.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — the public site and the admin
dashboard (`/admin`) are both served from this one app. Log in with
the account you created in step 2.

## Roles

| Role | Can do |
|---|---|
| `editor` | Create/edit vehicles, manage inquiries |
| `admin` | Everything `editor` can, plus delete vehicles |
| `super_admin` | Everything `admin` can, plus manage feature flags and other users' roles |

## Importing vehicles from CSV

**Admin → רכבים → ייבוא מ-CSV.** Drop in a **.csv or .xlsx/.xlsm** file
whose header row uses
the same Hebrew field names as the vehicle form (יצרן, דגם, שנה, מחיר,
מספר מלאי…). The importer:

- maps Hebrew headers to database columns (tolerating apostrophe/
  gershayim variants and Excel's BOM)
- translates Hebrew enum values — `בנזין`/`דיזל`/`היברידי`/`בנזין-חשמל`/
  `חשמלי` for fuel, `הנעה קדמית`/`אחורית`/`כפולה`/`4X4` for drive, etc.
- splits comma-separated cells like תוספות ואבזור into separate tags
- validates every row against the same rules the form uses, and shows a
  per-row error list before importing anything
- skips rows whose מספר מלאי already exists (or repeats within the file)
  rather than failing the whole batch, and reports them afterward
- derives a unique SEO slug per vehicle, de-duplicating collisions

Excel files are read as workbooks (first sheet) rather than as text,
which avoids the Hebrew-mangling and comma-inside-cell problems of
Excel's own CSV export — so .xlsx is generally the safer format to use.
Both formats run through identical validation.

Unrecognised columns are listed and ignored. Note that a תמונה column
containing image *links* is not imported — vehicle photos are uploaded
through the edit screen, which stores them in Supabase Storage.

## Deploying

**Vercel** (the only thing to deploy — Supabase is already hosted):

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) → import the repo. Vercel
   auto-detects Vite; no config needed.
3. Environment variables (**Settings → Environment Variables**):
   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and
   `VITE_SITE_URL` (your Vercel domain, once you have it — fine to
   add after the first deploy and redeploy).
4. Deploy.

Since this is a single-page app with client-side routing, direct
links to a route like `/admin/vehicles` have to be rewritten to
`index.html` so React Router can handle them. Vercel does **not** do
this automatically for Vite projects — without it, opening
`/admin` directly returns Vercel's own 404 page before the app ever
loads. `vercel.json` in the repo root configures the rewrite (with
`assets/` and `favicon.svg` excluded so real files still serve
normally).

## Project structure

```
supabase/
  schema.sql   Tables, RLS policies, storage bucket
  seed.sql     Demo inventory
src/
  lib/         Supabase client, Zod schemas, formatting helpers
  types/       Hand-written types matching the Supabase schema
  hooks/       Data-fetching hooks (vehicles, images, inquiries, auth, ...)
  components/  Shared UI + layout components
  pages/
    public/    Home, inventory, vehicle detail
    admin/     Login, dashboard, vehicle CRUD, inquiries, settings
```

## What's here vs. what's next

This covers the core of the original spec: full vehicle CRUD with
image management, publish/unpublish, status tracking, customer
inquiries, an activity log, role-based access, and a public site with
search/filtering and SEO-friendly URLs.

Deliberately not rebuilt from the earlier, more complex version of
this project: CSV import/export, a dedicated reports view, and the
"Future Integrations" list from the original spec (WhatsApp Business
API, trade-in valuation, etc.) — the `feature_flags` table is seeded
with placeholders for these so they're easy to wire in later without
a schema change.
